Writers use strong descriptive words to describe images, sounds, tastes, smells, and feelings.

                                <p>In 1930’s Cuba, where music is a large part of everyday life, a young girl dreams of playing the drums. There is a rule on the island, however, that only boys can play the drums. So the girl has to play in secret. During the day, the girl listens to all the sounds around her and imagines herself playing her own music. At home, she makes music by drumming her fingertips on tables and chairs. She plays and plays, even as everyone reminds her that girls are not allowed to play the drums. </p>
                                <p>The young girl’s sisters are so impressed with her music that they invite her to join their all-girl dance band. Her father, however, reminds her that only boys should play the drums. So the girl keeps dreaming and drumming on her own. After awhile, when her father sees that she willnot give up, he offers to find a music teacher who could decide if she should play the drums. The teacher is amazed at what the girl already knows and teaches her more and more. The girl practices and practices until she is ready to play at an outdoor cafe. When the people hear how good she is, they decide that girls should be allowed to play drums. </p>
                                 <p><span class="bold">Note:</span> This story was inspired by the true story of Millo Castro Zaldarriaga, a Chinese-African-Cuban girl who broke Cuba's taboo against female drummers. </p>

By continuing on with her dream and never giving up, the drum dream girl is able to help make the people around her realize and appreciate that some rules are meant to be broken.

                            <p>Begin the activity by having students recall how Milton and his friends in the Stop Bullying Now video dealt with bullying. Then have them recall what Ibtihaj Muhammad had to say about her own experience with bullying. </p>
                            <p>You might share situations in your life where your own pride or sense of self helped you overcome a difficult situation. For example, “When I was in fifth grade, classmates made fun of me because they thought my singing sounded funny. I ignored them and just sang louder and prouder!” </p>
                            <p>1.Now pose this question: Why might feeling proud of who you are help you deal with a problem like bullying?</p>
                           <p>2. Have students think about this question on their own, and then turn and talk to discuss it with a partner. Then, have partners discuss the question with the whole class. (Note that some students may not feel comfortable sharing experiences with bullying. In that case, they can discuss the question as it relates to the two videos that they viewed.)</p>
                           <p>3. Prompt the whole class discussion with guiding questions such as the following: </p>
                           <ul class="small-bullet">
                               <li>How does Faizah feel when she first hears the bully laughing at Asiya? Why? <i> (Faizah doesn’t understand it; she asks why; she can’t understand why others don’t see Asiya’s hijab the same way she does—proud and beautiful.)</i></li>
                               <li>How are Faizah’s reactions to the bullying different from Asiya’s? <i> (Asiya and her friends calmly go back to playing tag; Faizah gets mad)</i></li>
                               <li>What might Faizah learn from Asiya about dealing with bullies? How does feeling proud help both girls? <i> (Faizah learns to stay proud of herself and ignore the bullies. This helps both Asiya and Faizah let go of the hurtful words.)</i></li>
                                <li>Have you ever had to overcome a big challenge like this? How did it make you feel about yourself?</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Have students work with partners to discuss the pictures they drew earlier.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold"> 1.</span> Discuss students’ examples of non-human movie or TV characters with human-like qualities. Some suggestions: a rat that can talk, read recipes, and cook in a kitchen; a teakettle or candlestick holder that can sing. If possible, share online cartoons in which nonhuman objects or characters act like people.  </p>
                            <p><span class="bold"> 2.</span> Ask students to describe how the characters acted like humans. What human qualities did they have?</p>
                            <p><span class="bold"> 3.</span> Remind students that in written stories, authors often describe nonhuman objects by giving them human qualities, such as laughing or speaking. Remind them that this is called personification. </p>
                            <p><span class="bold"> 4.</span> Ask student pairs to identify an example of personification on the last two pages of the story. <i> (30–31; Asiya’s hijab says “hello with a loud wave”; it says “I’ll always be here, like sisters.”) </p>
                            <p><span class="bold"> 5.</span> Have partners discuss why this is an example of personification. <i> (A hijab is an object, so it cannot talk. That is a human quality.)</i> </p>
                            <p><span class="bold"> 6.</span> Ask students to identify what idea or image the author wants to help readers picture. <i> (It is as if the hijab is speaking to Faizah, welcoming her and reassuring her. It shows that Asiya’s hijab is special to both sisters.)</i> </p>
                            <p><span class="bold"> 7.</span> Now have students write a sentence that uses personification to describe Asiya’s hijab to show that it is special.</i> </p>
